# HTML, CSS Portfolio Website

Hey guys! ðŸ˜Š This is a project I made after learning on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7PnWnTgusc&ab_channel=JulioCodes). It is a simple static website that uses HTML, CSS and JS. I also used AOS JS for my animations and FontAwesome for my icons. 


To date, I am quite new to Frontend Design :neutral_face: but would like to expand upon on more concepts such as server side scripting and more advanced CSS.

## Structure and Processes

As per the tutorial, I split my website into header, sections and footer.
> Example Header
```HTML
<header>
    <div class="menu-toggler">
        <!-- NAV BAR TOGGLE -->
    </div>
    <nav class="top-nav">
        <!--  NAV BAR HTML CODE  -->
    </nav>
    <div class="landing-text">
        <!--  TEXT   -->
  </div>
</header>
```
For the CSS Portion, I followed the tutorial to create the main portion first, then added @media queries for smaller devices:
> Example media query CSS
```CSS
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px){
    body{
        background: url("./images/sitebg2.jpg" ) no-repeat center fixed;
        background-size: cover;
    }
    
  /* OTHER CSS CODE */
  
  }
```
I then reorganized my HTML, adding my own text and images. I also experimented with changing icons and color palettes to customize it to my own needs.

## What I have learnt
Overall, following this template has been an enriching experience for me. Previously, I had basic HTML and CSS experience but haven't actually implemented them in my own project.
I have learnt how to implement CSS techniques such as hover and media queries. Personally, I feel like I have much more to learn and will be building more websites in the future! ðŸ˜ƒ

## What can be improved
I still feel that I still need more practice to be able to create something like this from scratch. I followed alot of documentation online on sites like StackOverflow to really get things working. Perhaps I can add a form and learn how to connect it to the backend. Also for JavaScript, I feel like I need more practice to really understand the script applied in this project as I am still quite new to the langauge. :persevere:
